# scipoptsuite-tutorial

Resources to try out the SCIP Optimization Suite. The data subdirectory contains a ZIMPL-model sscflp.zpl of the
single source capacitated facility location problem, as well as a couple of data files.

The data files contain different facility location problem instances with up to 50 facilities and 1000 customers.
The data files are modified versions (leaving the actual problem data unchanged) 
of the OR library from http://or-brescia.unibs.it/instances/instances_sscflp

The tutorial requires the download of SCIP for your operating system under the link 
https://scip.zib.de#download

The installers for all the platforms already support the parsing of ZIMPL models. 
For diving deeper into SCIP, it is recommended to download and compile SCIP from the source code package, which includes supplementary coding examples.
